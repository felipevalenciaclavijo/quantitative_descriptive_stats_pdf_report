Significant Program Proposal

(This is a proposal. All proposals are written with our best knowledge
at the beginning of a project. As we progress from the beginning to the
end of a project, we gain more knowledge, and some of the ideas we
proposed change. This is part of completing any project and is fine.
However, we still must write a proposal so that our teachers or
supervisors know what we intend to do. Please answer each of the
following questions to the best of your knowledge.)

1. What is the title of your program? Quantitative Descriptive Statistics

2. What real world problem will your program address or help to solve? When doing a quantitative analysis
or statistical test it's important to first understand the data you have and see if it follows certain rules,
such as if the data follows a normal distribution, the shape of the data distribution, the summary statistics,
the confidence interval, etc.
This program would help me automate many tasks as a data analyst and boost my productivity when doing
descriptive statistics.


3. What will you learn from developing this program? I'll learn how to create various data visualisations (Box
Plot, QQ Plot, and Histogram) in Python and how to create a report file from the quantitative analysis.

4. What Python modules will your program use? (Some examples are: csv,
datetime, functools, matplotlib, math, pandas, pytest, random, requests,
and tkinter.) As of right now, I know it will use csv, matplotlib, math, pandas, pytest and perhaps other modules
for creating a pdf or a document file where I can store text and images from the process (like a report).

5. Will you separate your Python program into functions that each
perform a single task? Yes, I will

6. Will you write test functions to test many of your program functions? Yes, I will
